5. Evaluation: Design and conduct an evaluation to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed
explanation system. Evaluate the system accuracy in explaining the cause of a decision.
6. Project Documentation and Presentation:
* Document all phases of the project,
* including the literature review,
* framework design
* LLM customization process
* prototype development
* evaluation results.
Prepare a comprehensive project report and a presentation summarizing the key findings, challenges, and
future directions for enhancing human-robot communication through LLMs.
