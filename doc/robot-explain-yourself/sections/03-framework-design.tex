\section{Framework Design}

\subsection{Architecture Overview}

The proposed framework integrates three main components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Perception Processing Layer}: Handles (sensor data aggregation), context extraction and previous knowledge comprehension
    \item \textbf{LLM Integration Layer}: Manages prompt generation and response processing
    \item \textbf{Human Interface Layer}: Provides natural language interaction capabilities
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Flow and Processing Pipeline}

The system processes robot perception data through a structured pipeline:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Environmental/Weather context extraction from sensor readings
    \item Path analysis and decision point identification
    \item Prompt template generation with structured information
    \item LLM query processing and response generation
    \item Natural language explanation delivery to users
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Requirements}

Key technical considerations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time processing capabilities for interactive use and real-time answers
    \item Modular design for different robot platforms
    \item Scalable architecture for various explanation types
\end{itemize}
