    This report presents the design and implementation of a system for enhancing human-robot interaction by enabling a robot to explain its decisions, particularly those related to low-level perception data, through natural language using a Large Language Model (LLM).
    The project explores current methodologies, builds an integration framework, fine-tunes an LLM, and validates the system through user evaluations.
