\section{Human-Robot Interaction Prototype}

\subsection{System implementation}

The prototype system was implemented using Python with the following key components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Path processing module}: Handles environmental data and context extraction
    \item \textbf{LLM interface}: Manages communication with local Ollama server
    \item \textbf{Conversation manager}: Maintains interaction history and context
    \item \textbf{User interface}: Provides command-line and potential interaction
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Core features}

The implemented system supports:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Interactive questioning about robot path decisions
    \item Real-time explanation generation
    \item Context-aware responses based on environmental conditions
    \item Conversation logging and history management
    \item Multiple scenario support for testing and evaluation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical architecture}

The system architecture follows a modular design:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{robotPathExplanation.py}: Main application logic
    \item \texttt{path.py}: Data structures for path and environmental information
    \item \texttt{llmModel.py}: LLM integration and prompt management
    \item \texttt{conversationLogger.py}: Interaction recording and analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usage scenarios}

The prototype supports various interaction scenarios:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Path selection queries (e.g., "Which path should I take if I want the easiest route?")
    \item Safety-related questions (e.g., "I have a heavy load. Which path is safest?")
    \item Time-constrained decisions (e.g., "I am in a hurry but want to avoid danger")
    \item Real-time updated decision (e.g., "Which path should i took according to the new datas that I provided ?")
\end{enumerate}
