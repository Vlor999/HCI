\section{LLM Customization}

\subsection{Model selection and comparison}

The project employed multiple LLM architectures to determine which one provided the most accurate answers while also offering the most comprehensive explanations.
The LLM used during this project are the next ones :
\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Model}      & \textbf{Size} & \textbf{Performance} \\
        \hline
        Llama 3.2           & 2.0 GB        & Baseline performance \\
        nous-hermes2:latest & 6.1 GB        & small model that explain lightly \\
        deepseek            & 8.1 GB        & Good reasoning, efficient and clear\\
        qwen3:30b-a3b       & 18 GB         & big model that provides good answers but take some time \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{LLM model comparison}
\end{table}

\subsection{Prompt engineering}

Effective prompt design proved crucial for generating relevant explanations. The system uses structured prompts that include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Environmental context and sensor readings
    \item Historical path information
    \item User questions and interaction history
    \item Domain-specific constraints and objectives
    \item Additional datas provided by the human or captors
    \item Typical question/answer results
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fine-tuning approach}

The customization process involved:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dataset creation with robot-specific scenarios
    \item Prompt template
    \item Response quality evaluation and iteration
    \item Integration with robot perception systems
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Customization}
The customizatino of the ollama model was done using firstly multiple models to compare the performance of each one.
Then with the model we do some fine-tuning, like giving to the llm some background information about the robot, the environment and the sensors.
But also how does the robot must answer to the user question, like giving a short answer or a long one.
There is also points about which points it must consider when answering and take in consideration will answering.
