      "question": "How does the robot decide the best path?",
      "answer": "The robot uses a combination of real-time traffic data and pre-defined rules to calculate the most efficient route."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did the robot revisit this location?",
      "answer": "The robot revisited this location because it detected a change in the environment, such as reduced traffic or a previously blocked road now being open."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the robot adapt to changes in the environment?",
      "answer": "The robot compares current conditions with past data and updates its decision-making process to account for new information, ensuring optimal navigation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if the robot encounters a familiar area?",
      "answer": "If the robot recognizes a familiar area, it recalls past decisions and evaluates whether the same choice is still valid based on the current context."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the robot handle conflicting data from past and present?",
      "answer": "The robot prioritizes real-time data over past decisions, ensuring that its actions are based on the most accurate and up-to-date information available."
