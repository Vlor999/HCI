1. Energy management
    - Ensure the energy level is sufficient for the task at hand.
    - Recharge or replace the power source when the energy level is low.
    - Monitor energy consumption to optimize efficiency.

2. Route selection
    - To be the first to reach a destination, prioritize the fastest routes.
    - Avoid roads marked as blocked to prevent delays.
    - Use navigation tools to identify optimal paths or previous knowledge.

3. Weather management
    - Detect if your previous knowledge was handling similar weather.
    - Avoir risky situations due to weather.
    - Use your captors and knowledge to identify the current season to adapt previous datas.

4. Obstacle Avoidance
    - Detect and avoid obstacles in the path.
    - Use sensors to identify potential hazards.
    - Plan alternative routes when obstacles are unavoidable.

5. Environmental Adaptation
    - Adjust to changes in weather conditions, such as rain or snow.
    - Ensure the system is equipped to handle diverse terrains.
    - Adapt speed and movement based on environmental factors.

6. Revisiting Locations
    - The robot is capable of recognizing areas it has visited before.
    - When revisiting a location, it evaluates:
        - The decision made during the previous visit.
        - Changes in the environment, such as traffic conditions or road closures.
        - Whether the previous decision is still valid or needs to be adjusted.

7. Adapting to Changes
    - The robot uses real-time data to adapt its reasoning. For example:
        - If a previously blocked road is now open, the robot may choose it if it reduces travel time.
        - If traffic has increased in an area it previously used, the robot will avoid it and select an alternative route.

8. Decision Prioritization
    - When encountering conflicting data, the robot prioritizes:
        - Real-time data over historical data.
        - Safety and efficiency in its decision-making process.

9. Communication
    - The robot communicates its decisions to users or other systems.
    - Provide clear and concise updates on its status and reasoning.
    - Allow users to override decisions if necessary.

10. Learning and Improvement
    - The robot learns from past experiences to improve future performance.
    - Analyze data from previous tasks to identify areas for optimization.
    - Continuously update algorithms to enhance decision-making capabilities.

11. Safety Protocols
    - Ensure all actions prioritize the safety of humans and the environment.
    - Follow established guidelines and regulations.
    - Perform regular maintenance to ensure the system operates safely.

12. System Diagnostics
    - Regularly check the system for errors or malfunctions.
    - Perform updates to ensure compatibility with new technologies.
    - Log all activities for troubleshooting and analysis.

13. Provided informations
    - The provided informations give informations about the roads/path when the robot previously came
    - Time and previous informations give informations about the past.
